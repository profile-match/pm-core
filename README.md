* A Database called IMP on this server

## build / deployment

To build and package the project, run the two following commands

The 2nd one can run on its own by running the following command :  
``` bash
java -Dswarm.ds.connection.url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/IMP?useSSL=false" -jar pm-core-swarm.jar
```
